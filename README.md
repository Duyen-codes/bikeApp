# Solita Dev Academy pre-assignment

Application for displaying data from journeys made with city bikes in the Helsinki Capital area.

## Project Description

## Tech Stack

Since there are no limits to which technologies to use, I have decided to go with MERN stack since I'm mostly familiar with and have really enjoyed working with JavaScript.

### Database

During the time of studies in Business College Helsinki, I was equipped with fundamentals of both relational databases (MariaDB, MySQL) and non-relational database (MongoDB). But I've gained more hands-on experience by building several projects with MongoDB so for this particular project, I still choose MongoDB atlas as cloud database.

### Frontend: ReactJS

React is my first JavaScript framework that I have picked up and built several web projects with it.

- React
- axios
- Material UI

### Backend: NodeJS + Express

My first experience with backend development was with PHP when I was studying fullstack development program. But since I've seen that NodeJS is more of in demand and it always appears in job search with React so I self-taught NodeJS and Express by doing personal projects and taking an online course by University of Helsinki. I have found it quite nice to work with since I always want to go for fullstack development. I'm also interested in Java and C#/.NET so I definitely want to extend my tech skills with other technologies in the future.

- nodejs
- express
- mongodb
- cors
- dotenv
- needle
- fastcsv
- csvtojson
- node-fetch
